With the task defined, you can now create the resource monitor. In this example, define the new monitor SimpleResourceMonitor on the source agent SOURCEAGENT, monitoring the directory C:\monitored for the existence or update of the file trigger1.go:

where:
    -p <configurationOptions>
        Determines the set of configuration options that is used to
        create a monitor request. If you do not specify the -p parameter,
        the default set of configuration options is used.

Agent Specification:
    -ma <agentName>
        Required. The name of the agent to perform the monitoring task.

    -mm <agentQueueManager>
        Optional. The name of the queue manager the agent is connected to.

Resource Specification:
  Exactly one of the following must be specified:
    -md
        Required. A directory path name to monitor.

    -mq
        Required. A queue name to monitor.

Monitor Specification:
    -mn <monitorName>
        Required. The name of this monitor. The characters '*', '%', and '?'
        are not allowed in monitor names.

    -mt <taskFileName>
        Required. The file name containing the XML task definition to be
        performed. Refer to the fteCreateTransfer command -gt parameter for
        details on how to create the XML task definition.

    -pi <pollInterval>
        Optional. The interval period between each poll of the monitored
        resource. Default is 1. The units for this value are specified
        using the -pu parameter.

    -pu <pollUnits>
        Optional. The units of poll interval period. Values are seconds,
        minutes, hours or days. Default is minutes.

    -rl <recursionevel>
        Optional. For a directory monitor, the number of levels of recursion
        the monitor should descend into the resource directory.
        Default is none.

    -bs <maximumBatchSize>
        Optional. The maximum number of trigger cases to perform in a single
        task. For example, if a value of 5 is specified and 9 trigger cases
        occur for a poll, then 2 tasks will be performed. The first task will
        correspond to triggers 1 to 5 and the second task will correspond to
        triggers 6 to 9. Default is 1.

    -tr <triggerCondition>
        Optional. The condition to define a trigger case for performing the
        task action.

        The format of the trigger condition for a directory monitor is:
            <condition>,<pattern>
            where <condition> can be one of the following values:
              match:
                  any file that matches the pattern.
              noMatch:
                  no file matches the pattern.
              noSizeChange=nn:
                  any file that matches the pattern and has a file size
                  that does not change for nn polling intervals, where
                  nn is a positive integer.
              fileSize>=nnUU:
                  any file that matches the pattern and has a file size
                  greater or equal to nnUU. Where nn is a positive integer
                  and UU is an optional unit of B, KB, MB, or GB.
                  The default unit is B (bytes).
              The default condition for a directory monitor is match.
            and <pattern> is a file name which can include an asterisk as a
            wildcard that matches zero or more characters. The default pattern
            is to match any file.

        The format of the trigger condition for a queue monitor is:
            <condition>
            where <condition> can be one of the following values:
              queueNotEmpty : the queue contains at least one message.
              completeGroups: the queue contains at least one complete group.
              The default condition for a queue monitor is queueNotEmpty.

    -pt wildcard|regex
        Optional. The type of the pattern used by the -x and -tr parameters.
        Valid values are:
            wildcard:
              the patterns are wildcard patterns, where an asterisk (*) matches
              zero or more characters and a question mark (?) matches exactly
              one character.
            regex:
              the patterns are regular expressions.

    -x <excludePattern>
        Optional. A pattern that specifies file names to exclude from the
        trigger. The trigger is specified by the -tr parameter. Default is
        to not exclude any files.

    -tc
        Optional. Indicates that the triggered file contains one or more
        file paths to generate a transfer request. The default format for the file's
        contents is one file entry on each line with the format either as <source
        file path> or <source file path>,<destination file path>. This option is
        available only for directory monitor triggers "match" and "noSizeChange".

    -tcr <pattern>
        Optional. Specifies a replacement regular expression for parsing trigger files.
        The pattern must be designed to parse each line entry completely with one or
        two capture groups. Group one defines the source file path and the optional
        group two defines the destination file path. This is the default behavior and can
        be changed using the -tcc parameter
        Note that you must also specify the -tc parameter.

    -tcc <srcDest|destSrc>
        Optional. Defines the regular expression capture group order. "srcDest" is the default,
        where group one is the source file path and group two is the destination file path.
        "destSrc" is the reverse: group one is the destination and group two is the source.
        Note that you must specify the -tcr parameter and the regular expression for "destSrc"
        that must have two capture groups.

    -jn <jobName>
        Optional. Job name reference. A user-defined identifier for the
        request.

   -mmd <monitor metaData>
        Optional. Specifies the user-defined metadata that is passed to the
        monitor's exit points. The parameter can take one or more name
        pairs separated by commas. Each name pair consists of a
        <name>=<value>. The -mmd parameter can occur more than once in a
        command.

    -dv <substitutionVariableDefaultValues>
        Optional. Parameter for the default values of substitution variables.
        If a value of a substitution variable is not specified as an RFH2
        property on the first message to be transferred, the default value
        will be used as the  substituted value in the task XML. The parameter
        can take one or more name pairs separated by commas. Each name pair
        consists of <substitution variable name>=<default value>. The -dv
        parameter is only applicable when monitoring a queue, so the -mq
        parameter must also be specified.
    -ix <filename>
        Optional. Define using an existing monitor XML file as a template in
        this monitor creation. The monitor XML file will be used to define the
        original parameter with any other parameter given in the command
        overriding their values.

    -ox <filename>
        Optional. Defines a filename to store the generated monitor XML. If
        this parameter is specified then the generated request will not be
        sent to the named agent, but written to the given filename. The
        default is to transfer to named agent.

    Security:

    -mquserid <user id>
        Optional. Specifies the user ID to authenticate with the command queue
        manager.

   -mqpassword <password>
        Optional. Specifies the password to authenticate with the command queue
        manager. You must also specify the -mquserid parameter.
        If you specify -mquserid but do not also specify -mqpassword, you
        will be asked to supply the associated password by a prompt. The password
        will not be displayed on the screen.

    -f
        Optional. Use this to overwrite a resource monitor configuration.
        For example when the resource monitor name you have chosen already
        exists on the resource monitoring agent and you want to update it
        rather than delete and re-create with the same name.

    -c
        Optional. This option can only be used with the -f parameter. This
        will clear the history of an updated resource monitor which will cause
        it to check the trigger conditions again.

    NB: Resource monitors are not supported by protocol bridge agents.
