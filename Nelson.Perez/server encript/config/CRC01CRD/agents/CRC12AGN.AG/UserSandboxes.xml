This XML document defines the sandbox locations that a user can read from and
write to.  The 'userSandboxes' property controls the use of this file.  If you
want the information in this file to be used, ensure this property is present
and set to a value of 'true'.

The access that a user has to the file system is determined using the following
two steps:
    1) Decide which set of rules apply to the user who requests the transfer.
    2) Determine if the user is permitted to read or write file data based on
    the set of rules identified in step 1.

    An example sandbox document is as follows:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <tns:userSandboxes
            xmlns:tns="http://wmqfte.ibm.com/UserSandboxes"
            xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
            xsi:schemaLocation="http://wmqfte.ibm.com/UserSandboxes UserSandboxes.xsd">
        <tns:agent>
            <tns:sandbox user="account[0-9]" userPattern="regex">
                <tns:read>
                    <tns:include name="/home/user/**"/>
                    <tns:exclude name="/home/user/private/**"/>
                </tns:read>
                <tns:write>
                    <tns:include name="/home/user/output/**"/>
                </tns:write>
            </tns:sandbox>
            <tns:sandbox user="guest">
                <tns:read>
                    <tns:include name="/home/user/public/**"/>
                </tns:read>
            </tns:sandbox>
        </tns:agent>
    </tns:userSandboxes>

This example shows a sandbox document that allows access to the file system for
any user making requests with an MQMD user name starting with 'account'
followed by a digit, and also any user called 'guest'.  The levels of access
vary. Users with names starting with 'account' have read access to all files
and directories under '/home/user', with the exclusion of the
'home/user/private' directory tree.  The 'account' users are also permitted to
write files anywhere in the '/home/user/output' directory or subdirectories.
Transfer requests that have a MQMD user name of 'guest' have more restricted
access and can read from the '/home/user/public' directory and all its
subdirectories only.

As shown in the above example, a sandbox document is composed of an <agent>
element that contains zero or more <sandbox> elements.  These elements describe
which rules are applied to which users.  The 'user' attribute of the <sandbox>
element is used to determine which requests the rules apply to.  The <user>
element is a pattern that is used to match against the MQMD user of the
request.  Matches are performed in the order that the <sandbox> elements are
listed in this file.  The wildcard characters are asterisk (*), which
represents zero or more characters and question mark (?), which represents
exactly one character, unless you specify a 'userPattern="regex"' attribute as
part of the <sandbox> element.  If you specify the 'userPattern="regex"'
attribute or value, the 'user' attribute is interpreted as a regular
expression.

If none of the <sandbox> elements specified in this file match the MQMD user
associated with the transfer request message, the transfer cannot access the
file system.

After a set of rules has been identified, these rules are used to determine
which files, or data sets, can be read from or written to as part of the
transfer.  Each rule can specify a <read> element, which identifies which files
can be read, and a <write> element. which identifies which files can be
written.  If you omit the <read> or <write> elements from a rule, it is assumed
that the rule will not permit any reads or any writes, as appropriate.

Each <read> or <write> element contains one or more patterns that are used to
determine whether a file is in the sandbox and can be transferred.  Specify
these patterns using the <include> and <exclude> elements: their 'name'
attribute specifies the pattern.  For example:

        ...
        <tns:read>
            <tns:include name="/home/user/**"/>
            <tns:exclude name="/home/user/private/**"/>
        </tns:read>
        ...

The include and exclude patterns are used by the agent to decide if it should
allow files or data sets to be read from or written to.  An operation is
allowed if the canonical file path or data set name matches at least one of the
included patterns and exactly zero of the excluded patterns.

The patterns specified using the 'name' attribute of the <include> and
<exclude> elements use the path separators and conventions appropriate to the
platform that the agent is running on.  If you specify relative paths, they
are resolved relative to the 'transferRoot' property of the agent.

The following characters are wildcards and have special meaning when you
specify them as part of the 'name' attribute of the <include> and <exclude>
elements:

        *   A single asterisk matches zero or more characters at the directory
            (or data set qualifier) level.
        ?   A question mark matches exactly one character at the directory (or
            data set qualifier) level.
        **  Two asterisk characters match zero or more directory levels (or
            data set qualifier levels).

Also, paths that end with a path separator have an implicit '**' added to the
end of the path.  So '/home/user/' is the same as '/home/user/**'.  For
example:

        /**/test/**        matches any file that has a 'test' directory in its
                           path.

        /test/file?        matches any file inside the '/test' directory that
                           starts with the 'file' followed by any single
                           character.

        c:\test\*.txt      matches any file inside the 'c:\test' directory with
                           a .txt extension.

        c:\test\**\*.txt   matches any file inside the 'c:\test' directory, or
                           one of its subdirectories that has a .txt extension.

        //'TEST.*.DATA'    matches any data set that has the first qualifier
                           of 'TEST', has any second qualifier, and a third
                           qualifier of 'DATA'.
